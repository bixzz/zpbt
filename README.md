Passionate about cybersecurity and coding since a young age, I delved into the world of cybersecurity at just 12 years old. Fascinated by the intricate dance between security measures and potential threats, I honed my skills in this dynamic field. At the age of 13, I took my first steps into the realm of coding, eager to build robust solutions that could safeguard digital landscapes. Since then, I've continued to push the boundaries of what's possible in both cybersecurity and coding, driven by a relentless curiosity and a deep commitment to securing the digital world.
